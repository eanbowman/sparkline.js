sparkline.js
============

A tiny script to draw a sparkline graph in canvas. IE9+, Chrome & FF tested.

IE8 is supported with a polyfill. ( https://code.google.com/p/explorercanvas/downloads/list )

I've added the ability to display a colour gradient as the sparkline moves left-to-right.

Usage: &lt;canvas class="sparkline" data-sparkline="1,2,4,7,8,8,5,3,2,1"&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt; where data-sparkline is a comma-delimited list of values.

Enjoy! Feel free to make suggestions for improvements. I have made an angular directive version which I may add to this git repository in the future.
